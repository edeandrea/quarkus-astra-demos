# quarkus-astra-demo

**`ASTRA`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.  

To use this project:

âœ… Clone the repo

âœ… Go to [https://astra.datastax.com](https://dtsx.io/workshop) and create an account

âœ… [Create a serverless database](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html)

âœ… [Download your secure connect bundle](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/obtaining-database-credentials.html) from the connect screen

âœ… [Create a token for your app](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) to use in the settings screen

âœ… Create and populate your application.properties file:

    cp  ./src/main/resources/application.properties.template ./src/main/resources/application.properties

âœ… Replace the following lines to point at your scb and with your token:

    quarkus.cassandra.cloud.secure-connect-bundle=<</PATH_TO_SCB.ZIP>>
    quarkus.cassandra.auth.password=AstraCS:<<REPLACE_ME:REPLACE_ME>>

If you prefer to stub out the code yourself, pull the `puzzle` branch instead and give it a try. This `main` branch has the required endpoints stubbed out.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

Once the application is running navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using `./mvnw package`.
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `/target/quarkus-app` directory.
Be aware that itâ€™s not an _Ã¼ber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: `./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true`.
 
  > Make sure you have a container runtime (docker/podman/etc) installed

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/quarkus-astra-demo-0.01-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image.

## Running on Red Hat Developer Sandbox
